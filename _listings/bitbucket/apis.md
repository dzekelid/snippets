- name: Bitbucket Get Snippets Username Encoded  Revision Diff
  description: |-
    Returns the diff of the specified commit against its first parent.

    Note that this resource is different in functionality from the `patch`
    resource.

    The differences between a diff and a patch are:

    * patches have a commit header with the username, message, etc
    * diffs support the optional `path=foo/bar.py` query param to filter the
      diff to just that one file diff (not supported for patches)
    * for a merge, the diff will show the diff between the merge commit and
      its first parent (identical to how PRs work), while patch returns a
      response containing separate patches for each commit on the second
      parent's ancestry, up to the oldest common ancestor (identical to
      its reachability).

    Note that the character encoding of the contents of the diff is
    unspecified as Git and Mercurial do not track this, making it hard for
    Bitbucket to reliably determine this.
